**Hi, my name is Sebastian Leng**

My email is sjleng@ucsd.edu.

My section is entitled "Explorations on in-context learning in LLMs", led by Prof. Arya Mazumdar.

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been learning about in-context learning for regression and classification tasks.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

In my Quarter 2 project, I would like to try to train my own transformer with data I generate to be able to perform regression and classification tasks.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One change I'd make to the approach for my current projects is making sure I fully understand the topics before starting to write code.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Some other techniques I would be interesting in using in my project are training more complex NNs and experimenting with other in-context learning tasks.
